## Setup Instructions

### 1\. Install Dependencies

Navigate into this directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

#### On Windows (Command Prompt):

Open Command Prompt and run this command, pasting your key in place of the placeholder.

```bash
set GOOGLE_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

$env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
```

## How to Test

After completing the setup steps, you can test the module by running:
